## Usage

### Azure devops PR review: 
- Navigate to a Azure devops Pull Request that you want a review for.
- Click the extension icon
- If you have not already, the extension will ask you to log in at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
- You get code review comments from ChatGPT in the popup window and in the file you have selected.

### Review selected code
- Select the code and click the code review button.

**Note:** Running the review multiple times often produces different feedback, so if you are dealing with a larger PR, it might be a good idea to do that to get the most out of it.

## FAQ

###

**Q:** Are the reviews 100% trustworthy?

**A:** This tool can help you spot bugs, but sometimes it is not 100% accurate. We are working on optimizing the queries to give you the best result.

###

**Q:** What aspects of the Pull Request are considered during the review?

**A:** Every file's diff is sent seperately to ChatGPT to avoid request size issue. Comment are added on every changed file based on the response.
